    To skip fetching the typescript package, define repository called `npm_typescript` before calling this.

    Args:
        ts_version_from: label of a json file (typically `package.json`) which declares an exact typescript version
            in a dependencies or devDependencies property.
            Exactly one of `ts_version` or `ts_version_from` must be set.
        ts_version: version of the TypeScript compiler.
            Exactly one of `ts_version` or `ts_version_from` must be set.
        ts_integrity: integrity hash for the npm package.
            By default, uses values mirrored into rules_ts.
            For example, to get the integrity of version 4.6.3 you could run
            `curl --silent https://registry.npmjs.org/typescript/4.6.3 | jq -r '.dist.integrity'`
