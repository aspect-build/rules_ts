    """Compiles one TypeScript project using `tsc --project`.

    This is a drop-in replacement for the `tsc` rule automatically generated for the "typescript"
    package, typically loaded from `@npm//typescript:package_json.bzl`.
    Unlike bare `tsc`, this rule understands the Bazel interop mechanism (Providers)
    so that this rule works with others that produce or consume TypeScript typings (`.d.ts` files).

    One of the benefits of using ts_project is that it understands Bazel Worker Protocol which makes
    JIT overhead one time cost. Worker mode is on by default to speed up build and typechecking process.

    Some TypeScript options affect which files are emitted, and Bazel needs to predict these ahead-of-time.
    As a result, several options from the tsconfig file must be mirrored as attributes to ts_project.
    A validator action is run to help ensure that these are correctly mirrored.
    See https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig for a listing of the TypeScript options.

    Any code that works with `tsc` should work with `ts_project` with a few caveats:

    - `ts_project` always produces some output files, or else Bazel would never run it.
      Therefore you shouldn't use it with TypeScript's `noEmit` option.
      If you only want to test that the code typechecks, use `tsc` directly;
      see [examples/typecheck_only](/examples/typecheck_only)
    - Your tsconfig settings for `outDir` and `declarationDir` are ignored.
      Bazel requires that the `outDir` (and `declarationDir`) be set beneath
      `bazel-out/[target architecture]/bin/path/to/package`.
    - Bazel expects that each output is produced by a single rule.
      Thus if you have two `ts_project` rules with overlapping sources (the same `.ts` file
      appears in more than one) then you get an error about conflicting `.js` output
      files if you try to build both together.
      Worse, if you build them separately then the output directory will contain whichever
      one you happened to build most recently. This is highly discouraged.

    Args:
        name: a name for this target

        srcs: List of labels of TypeScript source files to be provided to the compiler.

            If absent, the default is set as follows:

            - Include `**/*.ts[x]` (all TypeScript files in the package).
            - If `allow_js` is set, include `**/*.js[x]` (all JavaScript files in the package).
            - If `resolve_json_module` is set, include `**/*.json` (all JSON files in the package),
              but exclude `**/package.json`, `**/package-lock.json`, and `**/tsconfig*.json`.

        data: Files needed at runtime by binaries or tests that transitively depend on this target.
            See https://bazel.build/reference/be/common-definitions#typical-attributes

        deps: List of labels of other rules that produce TypeScript typings (.d.ts files)

        tsconfig: Label of the tsconfig.json file to use for the compilation.
            To support "chaining" of more than one extended config, this label could be a target that
            provides `TsConfigInfo` such as `ts_config`.

            By default, if a "tsconfig.json" file is in the same folder with the ts_project rule, it is used.

            Instead of a label, you can pass a dictionary matching the JSON schema.

            See [/docs/tsconfig.md] for detailed information.

        extends: Label of the tsconfig file referenced in the `extends` section of tsconfig
            To support "chaining" of more than one extended config, this label could be a target that
            provdes `TsConfigInfo` such as `ts_config`.

        args: List of strings of additional command-line arguments to pass to tsc.
            See https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html#compiler-options
            Typically useful arguments for debugging are `--listFiles` and `--listEmittedFiles`.

        transpiler: A custom transpiler tool to run that produces the JavaScript outputs instead of `tsc`.

            By default, `ts_project` expects `.js` outputs to be written in the same action
            that does the type-checking to produce `.d.ts` outputs.
            This is the simplest configuration, however `tsc` is slower than alternatives.
            It also means developers must wait for the type-checking in the developer loop.

            See [/docs/transpiler.md] for more details.

        validate: Whether to check that the dependencies are valid and the tsconfig JSON settings match the attributes on this target.
            Set this to `False` to skip running our validator, in case you have a legitimate reason for these to differ,
            e.g. you have a setting enabled just for the editor but you want different behavior when Bazel runs `tsc`.


        root_dir: String specifying a subdirectory under the input package which should be consider the
            root directory of all the input files.
            Equivalent to the TypeScript --rootDir option.
            By default it is '.', meaning the source directory where the BUILD file lives.

        out_dir: String specifying a subdirectory under the bazel-out folder where outputs are written.
            Equivalent to the TypeScript --outDir option.
            Note that Bazel always requires outputs be written under a subdirectory matching the input package,
            so if your rule appears in path/to/my/package/BUILD.bazel and out_dir = "foo" then the .js files
            will appear in bazel-out/[arch]/bin/path/to/my/package/foo/*.js.
            By default the out_dir is '.', meaning the packages folder in bazel-out.

        tsc: Label of the TypeScript compiler binary to run.
            This allows you to use a custom compiler.
        tsc_worker: Label of a custom TypeScript compiler binary which understands Bazel's persistent worker protocol.
        validator: Label of the tsconfig validator to run when `validate = True`.
        allow_js: Whether TypeScript will read .js and .jsx files.
            When used with `declaration`, TypeScript will generate `.d.ts` files from `.js` files.
        resolve_json_module: None | Boolean; Specifies whether TypeScript will read .json files. Defaults to None.
            If set to True or False and tsconfig is a dict, resolveJsonModule is set in the generated config file.
            If set to None and tsconfig is a dict, resolveJsonModule is unset in the generated config and typescript
            default or extended tsconfig value will be load bearing.
        declaration_dir: String specifying a subdirectory under the bazel-out folder where generated declaration
            outputs are written. Equivalent to the TypeScript --declarationDir option.
            By default declarations are written to the out_dir.
        declaration: Whether the `declaration` bit is set in the tsconfig.
            Instructs Bazel to expect a `.d.ts` output for each `.ts` source.
        source_map: Whether the `sourceMap` bit is set in the tsconfig.
            Instructs Bazel to expect a `.js.map` output for each `.ts` source.
        declaration_map: Whether the `declarationMap` bit is set in the tsconfig.
            Instructs Bazel to expect a `.d.ts.map` output for each `.ts` source.
        preserve_jsx: Whether the `jsx` value is set to "preserve" in the tsconfig.
            Instructs Bazel to expect a `.jsx` or `.jsx.map` output for each `.tsx` source.
        composite: Whether the `composite` bit is set in the tsconfig.
            Instructs Bazel to expect a `.tsbuildinfo` output and a `.d.ts` output for each `.ts` source.
        incremental: Whether the `incremental` bit is set in the tsconfig.
            Instructs Bazel to expect a `.tsbuildinfo` output.
        emit_declaration_only: Whether the `emitDeclarationOnly` bit is set in the tsconfig.
            Instructs Bazel *not* to expect `.js` or `.js.map` outputs for `.ts` sources.
        ts_build_info_file: The user-specified value of `tsBuildInfoFile` from the tsconfig.
            Helps Bazel to predict the path where the .tsbuildinfo output is written.
        supports_workers: Whether the worker protocol is enabled.
            To disable worker mode for a particular target set `supports_workers` to `False`.
            Worker mode can be controlled as well via `--strategy` and `mnemonic` and  using .bazelrc.

            Putting this to your .bazelrc will disable it globally.

            ```
            build --strategy=TsProject=sandboxed
            ```
