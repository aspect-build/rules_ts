    """Compiles one TypeScript project using `tsc --project`.

    This is a drop-in replacement for the `tsc` rule automatically generated for the "typescript"
    package, typically loaded from `@npm//typescript:package_json.bzl`.
    Unlike bare `tsc`, this rule understands the Bazel interop mechanism (Providers)
    so that this rule works with others that produce or consume TypeScript typings (`.d.ts` files).

    One of the benefits of using ts_project is that it understands the [Bazel Worker Protocol]
    which makes the overhead of starting the compiler be a one-time cost.
    Worker mode is on by default to speed up build and typechecking process.

    Some TypeScript options affect which files are emitted, and Bazel needs to predict these ahead-of-time.
    As a result, several options from the tsconfig file must be mirrored as attributes to ts_project.
    A validation action is run to help ensure that these are correctly mirrored.
    See https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig for a listing of the TypeScript options.

    If you have problems getting your `ts_project` to work correctly, read the dedicated
    [troubleshooting guide](/docs/troubleshooting.md).

    [Bazel Worker Protocol]: https://bazel.build/remote/persistent

    Args:
        name: a name for this target

        srcs: List of labels of TypeScript source files to be provided to the compiler.

            If absent, the default is set as follows:

            - Include all TypeScript files in the package, recursively.
            - If `allow_js` is set, include all JavaScript files in the package as well.
            - If `resolve_json_module` is set, include all JSON files in the package,
              but exclude `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, and `tsconfig*.json`.

        assets: Files which are needed by a downstream build step such as a bundler.

            These files are **not** included as inputs to any actions spawned by `ts_project`.
            They are not transpiled, and are not visible to the type-checker.
            Instead, these files appear among the *outputs* of this target.

            A typical use is when your TypeScript code has an import that TS itself doesn't understand
            such as

            `import './my.scss'`

            and the type-checker allows this because you have an "ambient" global type declaration like

            `declare module '*.scss' { ... }`

            A bundler like webpack will expect to be able to resolve the `./my.scss` import to a file
            and doesn't care about the typing declaration. A bundler runs as a build step,
            so it does not see files included in the `data` attribute.

            Note that `data` is used for files that are resolved by some binary, including a test
            target. Behind the scenes, `data` populates Bazel's Runfiles object in `DefaultInfo`,
            while this attribute populates the `transitive_sources` of the `JsInfo`.

        data: Files needed at runtime by binaries or tests that transitively depend on this target.
            See https://bazel.build/reference/be/common-definitions#typical-attributes

        deps: List of targets that produce TypeScript typings (`.d.ts` files)

            If this list contains linked npm packages, npm package store targets or other targets that provide
            `JsInfo`, `NpmPackageStoreInfo` providers are gathered from `JsInfo`. This is done directly from
            the `npm_package_store_deps` field of these. For linked npm package targets, the underlying
            `npm_package_store` target(s) that back the links is used. Gathered `NpmPackageStoreInfo`
            providers are propagated to the direct dependencies of downstream linked `npm_package` targets.

            NB: Linked npm package targets that are "dev" dependencies do not forward their underlying
            `npm_package_store` target(s) through `npm_package_store_deps` and will therefore not be
            propagated to the direct dependencies of downstream linked `npm_package` targets. npm packages
            that come in from `npm_translate_lock` are considered "dev" dependencies if they are have
            `dev: true` set in the pnpm lock file. This should be all packages that are only listed as
            "devDependencies" in all `package.json` files within the pnpm workspace. This behavior is
            intentional to mimic how `devDependencies` work in published npm packages.

        tsconfig: Label of the tsconfig.json file to use for the compilation.
            To support "chaining" of more than one extended config, this label could be a target that
            provides `TsConfigInfo` such as `ts_config`.

            By default, if a "tsconfig.json" file is in the same folder with the ts_project rule, it is used.

            Instead of a label, you can pass a dictionary matching the JSON schema.

            See [docs/tsconfig.md](/docs/tsconfig.md) for detailed information.

        extends: Label of the tsconfig file referenced in the `extends` section of tsconfig
            To support "chaining" of more than one extended config, this label could be a target that
            provdes `TsConfigInfo` such as `ts_config`.

        args: List of strings of additional command-line arguments to pass to tsc.
            See https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html#compiler-options
            Typically useful arguments for debugging are `--listFiles` and `--listEmittedFiles`.

        transpiler: A custom transpiler tool to run that produces the JavaScript outputs instead of `tsc`.

            Under `--@aspect_rules_ts//ts:default_to_tsc_transpiler`, the default is to use `tsc` to produce
            `.js` outputs in the same action that does the type-checking to produce `.d.ts` outputs.
            This is the simplest configuration, however `tsc` is slower than alternatives.
            It also means developers must wait for the type-checking in the developer loop.

            Without `--@aspect_rules_ts//ts:default_to_tsc_transpiler`, an explicit value must be set.
            This may be the string `"tsc"` to explicitly choose `tsc`, just like the default above.

            It may also be any rule or macro with this signature: `(name, srcs, **kwargs)`

            See [docs/transpiler.md](/docs/transpiler.md) for more details.

        validate: Whether to check that the dependencies are valid and the tsconfig JSON settings match the attributes on this target.
            Set this to `False` to skip running our validator, in case you have a legitimate reason for these to differ,
            e.g. you have a setting enabled just for the editor but you want different behavior when Bazel runs `tsc`.

        root_dir: String specifying a subdirectory under the input package which should be consider the
            root directory of all the input files.
            Equivalent to the TypeScript --rootDir option.
            By default it is '.', meaning the source directory where the BUILD file lives.

        out_dir: String specifying a subdirectory under the bazel-out folder where outputs are written.
            Equivalent to the TypeScript --outDir option.

            Note that Bazel always requires outputs be written under a subdirectory matching the input package,
            so if your rule appears in `path/to/my/package/BUILD.bazel` and out_dir = "foo" then the .js files
            will appear in `bazel-out/[arch]/bin/path/to/my/package/foo/*.js`.

            By default the out_dir is the package's folder under bazel-out.

        tsc: Label of the TypeScript compiler binary to run.
            This allows you to use a custom API-compatible compiler in place of the regular `tsc` such as a custom `js_binary` or Angular's `ngc`.
            compatible with it such as Angular's `ngc`.

            See examples of use in [examples/custom_compiler](https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_ts/blob/main/examples/custom_compiler/BUILD.bazel)

        tsc_worker: Label of a custom TypeScript compiler binary which understands Bazel's persistent worker protocol.
        validator: Label of the tsconfig validator to run when `validate = True`.
        allow_js: Whether TypeScript will read .js and .jsx files.
            When used with `declaration`, TypeScript will generate `.d.ts` files from `.js` files.
        resolve_json_module: Boolean; specifies whether TypeScript will read .json files.
            If set to True or False and tsconfig is a dict, resolveJsonModule is set in the generated config file.
            If set to None and tsconfig is a dict, resolveJsonModule is unset in the generated config and typescript
            default or extended tsconfig value will be load bearing.

        declaration_dir: String specifying a subdirectory under the bazel-out folder where generated declaration
            outputs are written. Equivalent to the TypeScript --declarationDir option.
            By default declarations are written to the out_dir.

        declaration: Whether the `declaration` bit is set in the tsconfig.
            Instructs Bazel to expect a `.d.ts` output for each `.ts` source.
        source_map: Whether the `sourceMap` bit is set in the tsconfig.
            Instructs Bazel to expect a `.js.map` output for each `.ts` source.
        declaration_map: Whether the `declarationMap` bit is set in the tsconfig.
            Instructs Bazel to expect a `.d.ts.map` output for each `.ts` source.
        preserve_jsx: Whether the `jsx` value is set to "preserve" in the tsconfig.
            Instructs Bazel to expect a `.jsx` or `.jsx.map` output for each `.tsx` source.
        composite: Whether the `composite` bit is set in the tsconfig.
            Instructs Bazel to expect a `.tsbuildinfo` output and a `.d.ts` output for each `.ts` source.
        incremental: Whether the `incremental` bit is set in the tsconfig.
            Instructs Bazel to expect a `.tsbuildinfo` output.
        no_emit: Whether the `noEmit` bit is set in the tsconfig.
            Instructs Bazel *not* to expect any outputs. Only a validation action is used.
        emit_declaration_only: Whether the `emitDeclarationOnly` bit is set in the tsconfig.
            Instructs Bazel *not* to expect `.js` or `.js.map` outputs for `.ts` sources.
        ts_build_info_file: The user-specified value of `tsBuildInfoFile` from the tsconfig.
            Helps Bazel to predict the path where the .tsbuildinfo output is written.

        supports_workers: Whether the "Persistent Worker" protocol is enabled.
            This uses a custom `tsc` compiler to make rebuilds faster.
            Note that this causes some known correctness bugs, see
            https://docs.aspect.build/rules/aspect_rules_ts/docs/troubleshooting.
            We do not intend to fix these bugs.

            Worker mode can be enabled for all `ts_project`s in a build with the global
            `--@aspect_rules_ts//ts:supports_workers` flag.
            To enable worker mode for all builds in the workspace, add
            `build --@aspect_rules_ts//ts:supports_workers` to the .bazelrc.

            This is a "tri-state" attribute, accepting values `[-1, 0, 1]`. The behavior is:

            - `-1`: use the value of the global `--@aspect_rules_ts//ts:supports_workers` flag.
            - `0`: Override the global flag, disabling workers for this target.
            - `1`: Override the global flag, enabling workers for this target.
