            # should customize the contents of hashFiles to capture any bazel input sources,

            # then a cache hit will load an existing cache and bazel won't have to do any work.
            # In the case of a cache miss, you want the fallback cache to contain most of the
            # previously built artifacts to minimize build time. The more precise you are with
            # hashFiles sources the less work bazel will have to do.
